Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
* It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”.
* It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.

Concepts of functional programming:
* Variables are Immutable
* Recursion
* Referential transparency
* Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order
