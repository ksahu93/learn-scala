Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a more powerful version of the switch statement in Java and it can likewise be used in place of a series of if/else statements.

Syntax:
A match expression has a value, the match keyword, and at least one case clause.

import scala.util.Random

val x: Int = Random.nextInt(10)

x match {
  case 0 => "zero"
  case 1 => "one"
  case 2 => "two"
  case _ => "many"
}

Match expressions have a value.
