Question: How do I get from my house to yours?

Imperative response:
** Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a left.
** Get on I-15 North until you get to the 12th street exit.
** Take a right off the exit like youâ€™re going to Ikea.
** Go straight and take a right at the first light.
** Continue through the next light then take your next left.
** My house is #298.

A declarative response:
** My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Eden, Utah 84310

Knowing the address assumes you have some sort of GPS that knows the imperative steps of how to get to your house.
